# The effect of Gerrymandering on the political ideology (Polarisation) of the House of Representatives Members
---
## Summary Overview

This paper explores the increasing polarization in the political ideology among members of the U.S. House of Representatives (HOR), focusing on the role of gerrymandering - the strategic redrawing of district lines. It argues that gerrymandering is a catalyst for political polarization in the HOR, facilitating factors such as voting preferences, demographic changes, and media influence. The paper highlights the shift from a moderate political ideology to more extreme positions, incentivized by the undemocratic nature of gerrymandering, which encourages incumbents to align with their most vocal voters. Through a quantitative analysis of nominal data, the paper seeks to provide empirical evidence supporting the claim that gerrymandering contributes significantly to the political polarization observed in the HOR. The study also reviews existing literature to build a case for the impact of gerrymandering on the political landscape and proposes hypotheses regarding the causal relationship between gerrymandering and political polarization.
